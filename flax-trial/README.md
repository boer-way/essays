Linore flax seed, purchased for the Rust Belt Linen Project through Fiberrevolution and developed by Oregon State University is a dual variey seed (fiber and oil seed). This seed was grown in partnership with Cold Springs Organics in Montana and is the only fiber flax grown at the commercial scale in the USA. [^1] Display flax gardens are now being grown across Pennsylvania, Ohio and beyond in support of reestablishing the American flax and linen textile industry.  Organizations to connect with and learn more about the initiatives to restablish American flax include the Rust Belt Fibershed, the Pennsylvania Flax Project and the North American Linen Association.

## Flax in America

Flax seed purchase and growing is the essential first step in the linen making process. Robert MacMaster's book ...Soctch-Irish Merchants in Colonial America (2009) is a classic study in the transatlantic flax seed trade between Belfast and Baltimore; the Lower Susquehanna Valley and beyond. Quoting from MacMaster..."The cultivation of flax for seed made rural communities in Pennsylvania, New York and New England integral to the Ulster market. American flax seed provided the essential first step in the linen making process and the flax seed export financed the sales of Irish linen.  Mercantile families of Belfast, Londonderry and Newry shipped linen and other dried goods and sent orders to merchants in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore for flaxseed, flour or orders for ships to be built."

## British Atlantic Trade

As MacMasters references, government incentives provided support to the early Irish linen economy.  "An act of the English Parliament in 1696 admitted Irish linens on favorable terms to the English market.  In 1705 the English Parliment opened the American Colonies to linen produced in Ireland. " 1731 the British Parliament permitted shipment of flaxseed and other colonial produce to Ireland and stimulated trade with a bounty payment on flaxseed from 1733. This trade support bolstered the economy of Ulster, a province of Ireland and American flax seed soon became to supply the entire Ulster market. The Westminister Parliment provided trade bounties and subsidies to support the flax trade. The Dublin Parliment and Linen Board also provided financial incentives. The flaxseed ships consigned to these American merchants by their Ulster counterparts carried passengers, redemptioners and servants on their outward voyage. Together these collective efforts enabled ships to sail to the port cities and inland towns of the American colonies." [^3]

## Cultivating Industry Development

MacMasters recounts... "The Linen Board, created by the Irish Parliament in 1711, further subsidized the flax growers by importing and distributing flaxseed (MacMasters, 2009, as cited in Gribbon, 1977)." [^4]  "Being determined to give Encouragement for the raising large Quantities of Flax in this Kingdonm,  the "Trustees of the Linnen Manufacture" offered five bushels of foreign seed for every acre contracted to be sown in flax (MacMaster, 2009  as cited in the Dublin Currant, 1723)." [^5]  "From the first the Board also paid bounties and premiums for high quality linen, supplied wheels and looms, and made grants for bleach greens and manufactories (MacMaster, 2009, p.15, as cited by McConaghy, 1979)." [^6]   "Flaxseed exports, which were shipped only to Ireland, rose steadily and became Pennsylvania's, third most impoirtant export after flour and bread, the staples of Philadelphias European and West Indian trade (MacMaster, 2009 p.69 as cited by Engal, 1974)."

"Hugh Davey and Samuel Carson, and several others, had established a base at Charlestown, Cecil County, Maryland where they could purchase wheat, flour & flaxseed."(MacMaster, 2009 p201 as cited by Johnston, 1881). [^8]   "From 1745-1750 Davey & Carson, merchants of falxseed, flour, wheat, rum and general dry goods, documented shipments of flaxseed in hogsheads in their letterbook correspondence." [^9]. This Maryland location was in close proximity to Pennsylvania trading centers in areas such as Philadelphia, and Lancaster providng a gateway for trade and commerce. Development in infrastructure such as the Pennsylvania and Forbes Road further enabled trade between the eastern and western parts of the Pennsylvania colony [^10] .



Flax was transported in a large cask or barrel typically made of wood called "hogshead" a term for a unit of measurement [^11].  "Since a hogshead contained seven bushels of seed,  Philadelphia shipped roughly 3000 hogshead in 1749, 6000 in 1750 and 10,000 in 1751." (MacMaster, 2009 p69-70 as cited by White). [^12]   "With the increase of imports of American flaxseed to Ireland, and Irish linen to the colonies, advertisements in the Belfast News Letter, the only newspaper in the north for ships sailing for New Castle, Philadelphia or New York comonly extolled the ships advantages for passengers, redemptioners and servants" (MacMaster, 2009. p70).  "Immigrants from Ireland especially Ulster whether free, bond servant or slave, supported the flax seed and textile trade.  Between the years 1768-72, shipowners hauled 233,065 bushels of flax, becoming the single most important export to Ireland.  In the eighteenth century the domestic linen industry expanded from annual exports of less than one million to forty million yards of cloth." (MacMaster, 2009. pix). "With expences adjusted, shipping earnimgs for flax was more profitable than the tobacco trade" (MacMaster, 2009. p285).
