In 1731 the British Parliament permitted shipment of flaxseed and other colonial produce to Ireland and stimulated trade with a bounty payment on flaxseed from 1733. This trade support bolstered the economy of Ulster a province in Ireland. The Westminister Parliment provided trade bounties and subsidies to support the flax trade. The Dublin Parliment and Linen Board also proviced financial incentives. Together these collective efforts  enabled ships to sail to the port cities and inland towns of the American colonies. [^2]
