Linore flax seed, purchased for the Rust Belt Linen Project through Fiberrevolution and developed by Oregon State University. is a dual variey seed (fiber and oil seed). This seed was grown in partnership with Cold Springs Organics in Montana and is the only fiber flax grown at the commercial scale in the USA!  Display flax gardens are now being grown across Pennsylvania, Ohio and beyond to support the rebirth of the flax industry.  Organizations to connect with and learn more about the initiatives to restablish the American flax market include the Rust Belt Fibershed, Pa Flax Project and the North American Linen Association.

As succinctly described in R. MacMasters book "Scotch-Irish Merchants in Colonial America" government support and incentives provided the support to the early Irish linen economy.  An act of the English Parliament in 1696 admitted Irish linens on favorable terms to the English market.  In 1705 the English Parliment opened the American Colonies to linen produced in Ireland (ix).  1731 the British Parliament permitted shipment of flaxseed and other colonial produce to Ireland and stimulated trade with a bounty payment on flaxseed from 1733. This trade support bolstered the economy of Ulster a province of Ireland and American flax seed soon became to supply the entire Ulster market.(x). The Westminister Parliment provided trade bounties and subsidies to support the flax trade. The Dublin Parliment and Linen Board also proviced financial incentives (xi). Together these collective efforts  enabled ships to sail to the port cities and inland towns of the American colonies. [^2]
