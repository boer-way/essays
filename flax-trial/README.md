Linore flax seed, purchased for the Rust Belt Linen Project through Fiberrevolution and developed by Oregon State University. is a dual variey seed (fiber and oil seed). This seed was grown in partnership with Cold Springs Organics in Montana and is the only fiber flax grown at the commercial scale in the USA!  Display flax gardens are now being grown across Pennsylvania, Ohio and beyond in support of the American flax industry.  Organizations to connect with and learn more about the initiatives to restablish American flax include the Rust Belt Fibershed, the Pennsylvania Flax Project and the North American Linen Association.

## Flax in America

Flax seed purchase and growing is the essential first step in the linen making process. The historical development of the American-Scotch-Irish flax industry is succinctly described in R. MacMaster's book ...Soctch-Irish Merchants in Colonial America (2009) "The cultivation of flax for seed made rural communities in Pennsylvania, New York and New England integral to the Ulster market. American flax seed provided the essential first step in the linen making process and the flax seed export financed the sales of Irish linen.  Mercantile families of Belfast, Londonderry and Newry shipped linen and other dried goods and sent orders to merchants in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore for flaxseed, flour or orders for ships to be built." (p.x) [^2].

## British Atlantic Trade

As MacMasters mentions government incentives provided support to the early Irish linen economy.  An act of the English Parliament in 1696 admitted Irish linens on favorable terms to the English market.  In 1705 the English Parliment opened the American Colonies to linen produced in Ireland (p.ix).  1731 the British Parliament permitted shipment of flaxseed and other colonial produce to Ireland and stimulated trade with a bounty payment on flaxseed from 1733. This trade support bolstered the economy of Ulster, a province of Ireland and American flax seed soon became to supply the entire Ulster market (p.x). The Westminister Parliment provided trade bounties and subsidies to support the flax trade. The Dublin Parliment and Linen Board also proviced financial incentives. The flaxseed ships consigned to these American merchants by their Ulster counterparts carried passengers, redemptioners and servants on their outward voyage. (p.xi). Together these collective efforts enabled ships to sail to the port cities and inland towns of the American colonies. [^3]

## Cultivating Industry Development

MacMasters review of literature recounts... The Linen Board, created by the Irish Parliament in 1711, further subsidized the flax growers by importing and distributing flaxseed. [4]  "Being determined to give Encouragement for the raising large Quantities of Flax in this Kingdonm,"  the "Trustees of the Linnen Manufacture" offered five bushels of foreign seed for every acre contracted to be sown in flax. [^5]  From the first the Board also paid bounties and premiums for high quality linen, supplied wheels and looms, and made grants for bleach greens and manufactories. [^6] (MacMasters, p15).
